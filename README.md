# Shopping App â€“ CS Senior Project

## About This Project

This Android shopping calculator app was developed as my senior project for the Computer Science program at BYUâ€“Idaho. It's designed to help users track and manage grocery expenses with ease, supporting price entry, persistent sales tax, and a reusable item list.

The current version is actively in development and focuses on providing a clean, simple foundation for tracking shopping expenses. A future version is planned to support advanced budgeting features for users receiving EBT or WIC assistance.

## Features

### âœ… Current Features
- Add and edit shopping list items with name, quantity/weight, and price
- Automatically calculates and updates a running total including sales tax
- Persistent storage of sales tax percentageâ€”set once, used for every trip
- Save and reuse frequently purchased items through a **"My Items"** list
- Add checked items from "My Items" to an active shopping trip (avoids duplicates)
- Continue unfinished shopping trips where you left off

---

### ðŸš§ Planned Features
- Support for managing **multiple shopping trips** using `shoppingTripID`
- Ability to rename, delete, and switch between saved shopping trips
- Allow users to **check off purchased items**, automatically:
  - Move checked items to the **bottom** of the list
  - Apply a **different color or visual style** to distinguish them

### ðŸŒŸ Future Expansion: EBT/WIC Support

A future version of this app is planned to provide enhanced budgeting functionality for users who receive government assistance:

- Mark items as **EBT** (exempt from tax) or **WIC** (free or produce-limited)
- Budget rules applied per item type (e.g., no tax for EBT, limits for WIC produce)
- Display **total costs for EBT, WIC, and out-of-pocket items** at the top of the screen
- Modified data models and logic to reflect real-world budgeting scenarios

This version will be developed as a **separate app**, cloned from the finalized shopping app codebase to ensure a clean and focused experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (core app logic)
- **Android Studio** (development environment and UI)
- **Room** (local database for persistent storage)
- **MVVM Architecture** (for clean and modular code organization)
