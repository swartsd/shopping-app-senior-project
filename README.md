# Shopping App â€“ CS Senior Project

## About This Project

This Android shopping calculator app was developed as my senior project for the Computer Science program at BYUâ€“Idaho. It's designed to help users track and manage grocery expenses with ease, supporting price entry, persistent sales tax, and a reusable item list. The project is being developed in two phases:

- **Regular Joe**: A simple, user-friendly version built for anyone who wants to manage their shopping totals with customizable features like multi-trip support and checkable items.
- **Regular Joe+**: A future expansion designed for users who receive EBT or WIC assistance, with additional budgeting logic, item categorization, and program-specific behavior.

The current version (Regular Joe) is actively in development and will serve as the clean foundation for the upcoming Regular Joe+ version.

## Features

### âœ… Current Features (Regular Joe)
- Add and edit shopping list items with name, quantity/weight, and price
- Automatically calculates and updates a running total including sales tax
- Persistent storage of sales tax percentageâ€”set once, used for every trip
- Save and reuse frequently purchased items through a **"My Items"** list
- Add checked items from "My Items" to an active shopping trip (avoids duplicates)

---

### ðŸš§ Planned Features (Regular Joe)
- Support for managing **multiple shopping trips** using `shoppingTripID`

### ðŸŒŸ Future Expansion: Regular Joe+

This version will be built on top of the Regular Joe foundation and will focus on enhanced budgeting functionality for users who receive government assistance:

- Mark items as **EBT** (exempt from tax) or **WIC** (free or produce-limited)
- Budget rules applied per item type (e.g., no tax for EBT, limits for WIC produce)
- Display **total costs for EBT, WIC, and out-of-pocket items** at the top of the screen
- Modified data models and logic to reflect real-world budgeting scenarios

This version will be developed as a **separate app**, cloned from the finalized Regular Joe codebase to ensure a clean and focused experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (core app logic)
- **Android Studio** (development environment and UI)
- **Room** (local database for persistent storage)
- **MVVM Architecture** (for clean and modular code organization)
